SubFaction - Created by Adam Rochford aka Caimen (2014)

ABOUT
SubFaction is a personal hobby project of mine built to be a political/trade space simulator. This is a prototype and is barely functional. 
I am planning on generating a procedural universe with unique characters from politicians to lowly scoundrels to secret double agents infiltrating corporations and governments. 
The engine is entirely written in javascript uitilizing JQuery, JQuery-UI, Tablesorter-Plugin and Chance.js. Please be sure to use the latest upgraded version of your favorite browser. 
Internet Explorer is not recommended as it's javascript engine is slow and I don't test in that browser. If your simulation becomes slow after some time, 
try hitting clear console to clear the screen log. Please report bugs to adamcrochford@gmail.com or submit a request to commit on github.

LICENSE
SubFaction is licensed under GPL.  All I ask is you keep my name in the credits and a link back to subfaction.com 

INSTALL
Everything should work right out of the box whether on a server or local machine.

Thanks and Enjoy.
